# Declaring a variable and printing it is so easy.

X = 23         #Here 23 is in integer formate.(int)
Y = "23"       #Here 23 is in string formate. (str)

print(X)
print(Y)


# Here one thing is clear that we will not be able to add X and Y.
# Because X = 23 is integer while Y = "23" which is str.
